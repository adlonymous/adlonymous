I'm a CS + Math Student at Rutgers University, and an Ecosystem Engineering Intern at Solana Foundation. Previously, I was a Developer Relations Engineering Intern at DAIN and Dialect (YC S20), and the Co-Founder of Stockpile Labs

I'm usually building, researching, or working on solutions in the Blockchain and AI space. Currently down the rabbit hole of high-performance distributed systems. Also jamming on some cool CS & Math topics in my free time
