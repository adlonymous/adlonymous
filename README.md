I'm a CS + Math Student at Rutgers University and a Developer Relations Advocate at Solana Foundation. Previously, I was an Ecosystem Engineering Intern at Solana Foundation and a Developer Relations Engineering Intern at DAIN and Dialect (YC S20).

I'm usually building, researching, or working on solutions in the Blockchain and AI space. Currently down the rabbit hole of high-performance distributed systems. Also jamming on some cool CS & Math topics in my free time
