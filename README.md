I'm a CS Freshman at Rutgers University - New Brunswick,  and Head of Growth at Solana University. Previously, I was a Developer Relations Engineering Intern at DAIN, Dialect Labs and Co-Founder at Stockpile Labs.

I'm usually building, researching, or working on solutions in the Blockchain and AI space. Currently down the rabbit hole of high-performance distributed systems. Also jamming on some cool CS & Math topics in my free time
