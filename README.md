I'm a CS Freshman at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, Developer Relations Engineer at DAIN and Head of Growth at Solana University. Previously, I was a Developer Relations Engineering Intern at Dialect Labs and Co-Founder at Stockpile Labs.

I'm usually building, researching, or working on solutions in the Blockchain and AI space. Currently down the rabbit hole of Multi-Agent Systems and how Blockchains can optimize for and create an Agentic economy. Also jamming on some cool CS & Math topics in my free time
